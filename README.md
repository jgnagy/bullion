# Bullion

Bullion is an [ACMEv2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555)-compatible Certificate Authority (just like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). Bullion makes it easy to leverage open standards for provisioning certificates for internal sites and services. Things like [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), and many other technologies work great with Let's Encrypt for _external_ hostnames, but for private domains and servers that aren't Internet accessible, there are few easy options.

Bullion installs easily (both as a ruby gem or a Docker image) and will shortly come with Kubernetes examples and even a helm chart to make installing it that much easier. For its data, Bullion works with either [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html) for very small sites (where HA and high-throughput isn't a concern) or with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)/[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).
